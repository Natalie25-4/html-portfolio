<h1>The best movies according to Natalie</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>The Blackening</h3>
<p>This is the first horror comedy parody that I have ever loved.</p>
<h3>Bleach</h3>
<P>Bleach is my favourite anime, I dont believe they make other anime's as good as this one. Thats just my opinion though.</P>
<h2>Me before</h2>
<P> I love this movie very much because it has such a good storyline and it made me cry.</P>
